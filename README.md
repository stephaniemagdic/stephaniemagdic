While navigating through my professional experiences as a middle school teacher and mental health professional, I was constantly intrigued by current software and creatively experimenting with software development, and so I joined Turingâ€™s Frontend Program. Since then I have built numerous applications (from wireframing to deployment). These projects are hosted here on Github. Please take a look! 

In my free time, I love to enjoy Coloradoâ€™s outdoors, take on new house projects, travel back to Chicago to see my family ðŸ’š, explore new technologies and dream up applications.

#### Currently deployed but still iterating on an [application](https://mental-health-fe.herokuapp.com/#/) (HeLP Network: Helping and Legal Professionals Network) that had been dreamt up as a mental health professional when I struggled to find the resources I needed to best serve my students. With some really amazing frontend and backend developers we are making this application come to life. (Technologies: React with context api, PWA with push notifications, typescript, styled components, and material ui!) -- [Repo here!](https://github.com/mental-health-org/mental-health-fe)

Some of my most recent favorites:
- [HeLP Network](https://mental-health-fe.herokuapp.com/#/): Professional Social Media application that allows helping professionals to consult on legal an ethical issues
- [Doth Translate](https://stephaniemagdic.github.io/doth_translate/): Shakespearean Context clues apps for students grades 5-8
- [Gone Phishin](https://stephaniemagdic.github.io/gone_phishin/): Mobile application that allows Phish fans to browse live show audio tracks - check out party mode ðŸŒˆ
- [Movie Buffer](https://stephaniemagdic.github.io/rancid-tomatillos/): Web application for recently-released movie browsing
