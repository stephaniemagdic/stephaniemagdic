While navigating through my professional experiences as a middle school teacher and mental health professional, I was constantly intrigued by current software and creatively experimenting with software development, and so I joined Turing’s Frontend Program. Since then I have built numerous applications (from wireframing to deployment). These projects are hosted here on Github. Please take a look! 

In my free time, I love to enjoy Colorado’s outdoors, take on new house projects, travel back to Chicago to see my family 💚, explore new technologies and dream up applications.

Some of my most recent favorites:
- [Doth Translate](https://stephaniemagdic.github.io/doth_translate/): Shakespearean Context clues apps for students grades 5-8
- [Movie Buffer](https://stephaniemagdic.github.io/rancid-tomatillos/): Web application for recently-released movie browsing
- [Gone Phishin](https://stephaniemagdic.github.io/gone_phishin/): Mobile application that allows Phish fans to browse live show audio tracks - check out party mode 🌈
- [Memory Travels](https://stephaniemagdic.github.io/travel-tracker/): Mobile application for and tracking travel data

#### Currently working on an [application](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ls9HiMY=/) that had been dreamt up as a mental health professional when I struggled to find the resources I needed to best serve my students. With some really amazing frontend and backend developers we are making this application come to life.
