[Turing School of Software and Design's Frontend Engineering program student](https://turing.edu/)

#### Always learning, always excited to grow and to maximize opportunities and resources available and take advantage of life’s opportunities. 

While navigating through my professional experiences as a middle school teacher and mental health professional, I was constantly intrigued by current software and creatively experimenting with software development, and so I joined Turing’s Frontend Program. Since then I have built numerous applications (from wireframes to deployment). These projects are hosted here on Github. Please take a look! 

In my free time, I love to enjoy Colorado’s outdoors, take on new house projects, travel back to Chicago to see my family <3, explore new technologies and dream up useful applications.
