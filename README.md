While navigating through my professional experiences as a middle school teacher and mental health professional, I was constantly intrigued by current software and creatively experimenting with software development to solve problems in the field, and so I joined Turing School of Software and Design's Frontend Program. Since then I have built numerous applications (from wireframing to deployment) that are hosted here on Github. 

In my free time, I love to enjoy Coloradoâ€™s outdoors, take on new house projects, travel back to Chicago to see my family ðŸ’š, explore new technologies and dream up applications.

Currently working on: [HeLP Network: Helping and Legal Professionals Network](https://mental-health-fe.herokuapp.com/#/) had been dreamt up as a mental health professional when I struggled to find the resources I needed to best serve my students. With some really amazing frontend and backend developers we are making this application come to life. (Technologies: React with context api, TypeScript, Material-UI, and [LinkedIn's Oauth](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authentication).
